    <string name="explanation">\n
            Smartphone sensors can leak <b>information, and it can be obtained by any app without permissions</b> in Android
        and thus invading privacy.\n
            This is a vulnerability which can be exploited by a <b>side-channel attack</b>.\n
            Our Final Year Project aims at establishing <b>a proof-of-concept</b> that an information being typed by the user on a smartphone can be
        illegitimately inferred from the smartphone motion while being typed.\n
            Kindly help us by providing sample data. We collect Keypresses, Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings while you type in this app. By clicking next, you agree to let us collect Keypresses, Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings (Only while you type in this app).
